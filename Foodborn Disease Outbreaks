# Foodborne Disease Outbreaks, 1998 - 2015
# 1. Has foodborne disease outbreaks gotten worse over the years? 2. Which month do they tend to occur the most? 
# 3. Which state of the US do they appear the most frequently?

# Has foodborne disease outbreaks gotten worse over the years? And which month do they tend to occur the most, and what state of 
# the United States do they appear more frequently? Thanks to the public health agencies that operate in all 50 states for 
# investigating outbreaks and gathering all this data from 1998 through 2015 and submitting it to the Centers for Disease Control 
# and Prevention (CDC). We will be able to display a clearer picture and pattern for foodborne disease outbreaks. A foodborne 
# disease outbreak is considered an outbreak when two or more people get the same illness after ingestion of a common food/liquid
# and epidemiological analysis implicates the food as the source of the illness, according to the CDC.

# In this graph it's pretty clear that California and Florida is the center of foodborne illnesses apparently. The high rate of 
# incidents could be related to their population rate during the years of 1998-2015. One would have to investigate significant 
# events that has transpired in those years that might have increased the chances of causing more foodborne illnesses in other
# states than others. An exceptional circumstance would be the outbreak of Salmonella Infections linked to Peanut Butter, 
# 2008 - 2009. Majority of peanut butter was sent to California and Ohio.

# As it can be seen on this graph, the trend of foodborne illnesses has decreased overall since 1998. Significant drop is from 
# 2008 - 2009 but now seems to be steady at the 800 - 900 cases ranges. Looking at this data, one can come to the conclusion that 
# foodborne diseases are occurring less frequently.  After my research, I would have to agree, but still skeptical. Reasoning
# behind that is because most foodborne infections go undiagnosed and unreported, either because the sick person doesn't see a
# doctor(that's me all the time), or the doctor doesnâ€™t made a specific diagnoses according to the 
# CDC. 

# The data shows the CDC and FDA(food and drug administration) that foodborne illnesses is decreasing and which months its at its
# highest and which states it affects the populace more. But little information as to why the data displays it. Gathering data on 
# the after match of regulations and policies that were created by the FDA could explain what impact they have or don't have.

# data anaylsis quality as you can tell from this function is missing a lot of data from ingredients of food that were the
# cause of illinesses. Also, missing serotype(classification of a bacteria) and Genotype(genetic trait). Both of these better
# classify what exactly disease caused the outbreak illnesses. I felt it best to graph what had the least amount of null data
# points, which was illnesses, year, month, and state.
